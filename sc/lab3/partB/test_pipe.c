/***********************
* Test function for pipe device driver.
* It receives:
* -> name of shared file passed as 1st argument
* -> data to write as a string in the 2nd argument

* This function should start two processes/threads: a producer and a consumer.
* Both processes/threads should open the file device /dev/mypipe ( hint: use fork()! Or threads... whatever you want! )
* The producer must write to it, and the consumer must read from it.
